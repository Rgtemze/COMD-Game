                Note that in the first turn, instructions located below the game map will guide you.
                <hr>    
                There are three types of promises: Education, Health and Transportation.
                <br><br> Each city has a primary promise whose icon is shown inside the city.
                <br><br> Each city has a population amount.
                <br><br> Goal is to hold maximum amount of population at the 10th turn. 
                <br><br> Each of your promises are counted as 1 point, while each primary promise that you invested are counted as 2 points
                <br><br> Total point is used to determine who acquired the city.
                <br><br> Cities that you can invest on are in white text.
                <br><br> Your occupied cities are colored in green.
                <br><br> Opponent cities are colored in red.
                <br><br> If you want to invest on a city, then you must have acquired a neighbour city in the outer circle.
                <br><br> You may even lose a city, if the outer neighbours of that city are all lost.
                <br><br> If you had invested on a city which is given up by another player, you can acquire that city only if your score is higher.

            Take your place in the “Prevalence”. There is no injustice in this game, no advantageous campaigns. Each player is <b>equal</b>, promises are limited, needs of the cities are determined. 
           There is only one randomness in this game:  <b>you and your strategies</b>. Use your promise cards to reach the victory. 
           There is no rule to restrict your promise choices in the game, there is <b>no concrete paths</b> to reach the victory.  However, do not forget that each decision is important and you should optimize the number of cards you give up. Do not trust yourself and the cities you have taken until the game ends. 
           There is <b>no mercy</b> in this game as there is no mercy in the real elections. 
           To win, you must consider both the cities you have taken and the cities you want to take at every round.  You can lose suddenly or you can have the first place by proper strategies in a few rounds. This is not chess, however, to win, one must play Prevalence as if one plays the chess. Not only the current ownerships are important, also a wise politician should consider the future. 
            <b>Do not stop planning.</b>

            <br>In 10 rounds, the winner will be known. In this game, there are only strategies well planned, mistaken moves taken 
            and there is only one winner at the end. At last, the only purpose is to <b>PREVAIL</b>.
