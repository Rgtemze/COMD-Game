                There are three types of promises: Education, Health and Transportation.
                <br><br> Each city has a primary promise whose icon is shown inside the city.
                <br><br> Each city has a population amount.
                <br><br> Goal is to hold maximum amount of population at the 10th turn. 
                <br><br> Each of your promises are counted as 1 point, while each primary promise that you invested are counted as 2 points
                <br><br> Total point is used to determine who acquired the city.
                <br><br> Cities that you can invest on are in white text.
                <br><br> Your occupied cities are colored in green.
                <br><br> Opponent cities are colored in red.
                <br><br> If you want to invest on a city, then you must have acquired a neighbour city in the outer circle.
                <br><br> You may even lose a city, if the outer neighbours of that city are all lost.
                <br><br> If you had invested on a city which is given up by another player, you can acquire that city only if your score is higher.
